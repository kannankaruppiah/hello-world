<h4>The online screening tool is now available in an interactive voice response (IVR) format. CALL 1-877-308-9038

It is not a replacement for Health Links-Info Sante. It is specifically for Manitobans who prefer to complete the screening tool by phone rather than online.

The tool asks callers standard screening questions for COVID-19. If needed, it directs those who may require a conversation with a health care professional to Health Links-Info Sant√©. People who want to self-screen can call 1-877-308-9038.</h4>
