<h1> Install Git
The two most common ways to install Git will be described in this section. Each option has their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice you make will depend on your own needs. For example, users who want to maintain updates to the Git software will likely want to use yum to install Git, while users who need features presented by a specific version of Git will want to build that version from source.

Option One — Install Git with Yum
The easiest way to install Git and have it ready to use is to use CentOS’s default repositories. This is the fastest method, but the Git version that is installed this way may be older than the newest version available. If you need the latest release, consider compiling git from source (the steps for this method can be found further down this tutorial).

Use yum, CentOS’s native package manager, to search for and install the latest git package available in CentOS’s repositories:</h1>
